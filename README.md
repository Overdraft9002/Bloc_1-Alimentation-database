In Bloc_1 file :
  - A "Data" file containing the results after running the scritps
  - kayak_project.py which creates the datasets
  - Main_S3_data_viz.ipynb which manages data visulization and uploads to S3
  
The Bloc should be "plug and play", simply download the file and run the .py and .ipynb scripts
